# Custom QClicks

### Why was it created for

Ever wanted to use QClick in a different way when playing adc? Or wanted to try different QClicks? Or even hated the way you had to activate your QClick (You **have** to use Mouse Left Button for example)?

Then these scripts are made for you.

-Made with autohotkey-

### Is it bannable?

These QClicks are just different ways to activate it. It respects the **1:1 ratio** (One trigger one action) and does not **automate anything**.
It does not give you any unfair advantage but rather, ease your gameplay based on your preferences.

Riot was of course contacted and **confirmed** that this is not bannable (+ it does not interact with the game in itself at all).


### Is it safe?
Scripts were made to be as short as possible, so everyone can verify that these scripts are safe to use.
You can check them or even modify them at will.

### Featured scripts

- **Right Click Q Click**: You hate clicking on left button to activate your QClick? Try this script which will allows you to activate it by clicking on the *right button* instead!
- **Hold Q Click**: You want to use the indicator range but prefer to use the *Player Movement Click* (activate your qclick with a single activation), then try this script. Bind the normal Q Click with indicator and hold it to show the range, as soon as you release your button it will activate the QClick.
- **Double Q Click**: You simply hate clicking on your button to activate your QClick and have higher APM with your keyboard? This Script will allow your QClick to be activated by clicking **twice** on it. So instead of *QClick --> LButton* it will be *QClick --> QClick*

### To use it

Go on autohotkey's website https://www.autohotkey.com/ and download it.  
Direct link: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe

When installed, chose *only one* QClick and double click on it. An autohotkey icon should then appear in your task bar (green logo).
That's it, it will only work in League of Legends and **will not** interfer in anyway with Windows or other programs.


### Configuration
The configuration is almost done, you will soon be able to use these scripts on any hotkey
